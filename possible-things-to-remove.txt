possible removable sense apps

[confirmed] MyTask.apk + MyTAskWidget.apk = to do app from HTC with location reminding / Maybe integrated with Sense account?
[do not delete] ChromeBookmarkSyncadapter.apk = sync bookmarks with google chrome browser on your computer
[confirmed] ShowMe.apk = HTC online video and book store?
[move to data] What about keyboard dictionaries? together around 10 MB

Jmz recommends:
Removing:
[do not delete] Flickr.apk [needed by gallery]
HtcStore.apk
MyDropbox.apk
MyHTC.apk
MySkydrive.apk

There are a lot of apks you can move to /data
***You can also symlink some stuff from /data to /system*** this will prolly be the best option (do you mean the other way around, that is a good option though)
Move all languages to /data IMEXT9*.apk (didn't I say that?)

possible removable libs
see changelog what I've removed, can it go further? CM9 contains way less.
::: CM9 IS NOT SENSE - REMEMBER TO MARK WHAT YOU DELETE, AND BACK IT UP :::

possible removable sounds
ringtones folder is 20 MB, we could strip 10 MB from it, BTW: sense roms allow your own ringtones I remembered. So only keep the best ones.

possible removable framework files
for now stay away. One question: what's purpose of framework-htc-res.apk?
A. Images

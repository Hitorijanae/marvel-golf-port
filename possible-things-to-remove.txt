possible removable sense apps
LMW.apk = low storage mode wizard / not needed when managing through settings
MySketcher.apk = sort of quick note app, writing with your finger
MyTask.apk + MyTAskWidget.apk = to do app from HTC with location reminding / Maybe integrated with Sense account?
SetupWizard.apk = not needed on HTC ROMS, HTCSetupWizard does the thing
Trimit.apk = trim your custom ringtones (not really necessary for me, do this on your pc)
HTCRingToneTrimmer.apk = WTF, same as previous
Updater.apk = OTA HTC updates, not needed when porting I guess
Videos.apk = also in CM9, create home videos
ChromeBookmarkSyncadapter.apk = sync bookmarks with google chrome browser on your computer
ShowMe.apk = HTC online video and book store?
What about keyboard dictionaries? together around 10 MB

Jmz recommends:
Removing:
AppSharing.apk
Flickr.apk
HtcStore.apk
MyDropbox.apk
MyHTC.apk
MyReportAgent.apk
MySkydrive.apk

There are a lot of apks you can move to /data
***You can also symlink some stuff from /data to /system*** this will prolly be the best option
Move all languages to /data IMEXT9*.apk
What you have now from this list is most likely a managable rom size. 
--------------------------------------

totally around 11,3 MB without the keyboard stuff

possible removable libs
see changelog what I've removed, can it go further? CM9 contains way less.

possible removable sounds
ringtones folder is 20 MB, we could strip 10 MB from it, BTW: sense roms allow your own ringtones I remembered. So only keep the best ones.

possible removable framework files
for now stay away. One question: what's purpose of framework-htc-res.apk?

What about xmls in MNS folder in customize folder? I know its for first setup wizard. It auto detects country based on network and applies language, keyboard language, calendar and time layout, APN settings etc â€¦ Just keep the default one?

possible removable sense apps

MyTask.apk + MyTAskWidget.apk = to do app from HTC with location reminding / Maybe integrated with Sense account?
ChromeBookmarkSyncadapter.apk = sync bookmarks with google chrome browser on your computer
ShowMe.apk = HTC online video and book store?
What about keyboard dictionaries? together around 10 MB

Jmz recommends:
Removing:
Flickr.apk
HtcStore.apk
MyDropbox.apk
MyHTC.apk
MySkydrive.apk

There are a lot of apks you can move to /data
***You can also symlink some stuff from /data to /system*** this will prolly be the best option
Move all languages to /data IMEXT9*.apk

possible removable libs
see changelog what I've removed, can it go further? CM9 contains way less.

possible removable sounds
ringtones folder is 20 MB, we could strip 10 MB from it, BTW: sense roms allow your own ringtones I remembered. So only keep the best ones.

possible removable framework files
for now stay away. One question: what's purpose of framework-htc-res.apk?

:::WARNING:::

Camera and contacts (or whatever HtcContacts+CRC_GolfU.odex) will not work because framework has been deodexed. They will only work if they are deodexed too.

:::SOLOUTION:::

a) Retry using different tools, other than dsixda's kitchen
b) Use the two APK's from a GOLF custom ROM that is deodexed
c) Decompile the two apks and decompile an apk from the one v, combine the resources together - including xmls, images, etc to make a working decompiled apk [extreme hardcore option]

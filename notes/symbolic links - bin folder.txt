sym linked files
-------------------------------------------

for some reason HTC decided it would be a good idea to symbolically link some bin's to other place, probably located in HTC's new HBOOT or recovery, we must fix this by using actual files - this is the list of files that we must find, please mark them with [DONE] on the end when found.

Here you can find all the stuff needed to cook Sense 4 for the HTC Wilfdire S.

The port is based on a HTC Desire C RUU: RUU_GOLF_U_ICS_40A_HTC_Europe_1.35.401.1_Radio_10.08.98.09H_1.05.98.08M2_release_260338_signed

The WFSDev Team will work together over here. Update changelog after changes!

Some notes:
- system partition is 269 MB on the WFS without partitioning.
====> ROM around 265mb now (Benjamin)

- maybe useful guide (not for sense 4, but could be useful)

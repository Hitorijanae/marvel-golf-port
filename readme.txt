Here you can find all the stuff needed to cook Sense 4 for the HTC Wilfdire S.

The port is based on a HTC Desire C RUU: RUU_GOLF_U_ICS_40A_HTC_Europe_1.35.401.1_Radio_10.08.98.09H_1.05.98.08M2_release_260338_signed

The WFSDev Team will work together over here. Update changelog after changes!

Two notes:
- system partition is around 270 MB on the WFS without partitioning.
====> 269MB exactly
- debloat as much so we shouldn't use data2sd and partitioning
====> Don't do that! It fits, don't change any more!
====> result from Henry: system folder 312 MB without data/app
====> Around 265mb now (Benjamin)

possible removable sense apps
LMW.apk = low storage mode wizard / not needed when managing through settings
MySketcher.apk = sort of quick note app, writing with your finger
MyTask.apk + MyTAskWidget.apk = to do app from HTC with location reminding / Maybe integrated with Sense account?
SetupWizard.apk = not needed on HTC ROMS, HTCSetupWizard does the thing
Trimit.apk = trim your custom ringtones (not really necessary for me, do this on your pc)
HTCRingToneTrimmer.apk = WTF, same as previous
Updater.apk = OTA HTC updates, not needed when porting I guess

how to fix errors from lolcat-29-05-12.16.29

* framework.jar
Sqlitedatabase: 	look for that smali in CM9 and replace
			or add field mCAnDumpMonitoredSql
Socket:			add field mSocketMonitor or replace with CM9 small

* android policy jar
Settings:		add field Lockscreen-custom-app-icons from Sense3.5 or replace with that smali
			add field Lockscreen-custom-app-activities from Sense3.5 or replace with that smali

illegal method access (call Lcom/android/internal/widget/DigitalClock;.updateTime ()V from Lcom/android/internal/policy/impl/LockScreen;) => NO IDEA, look for digitalclock smali or lockscreen small and find something from sense 3.5 or 2.1

* filterfw.jar
PackageRedirectionMap		not found, get it from CM9
SQLiteDatabase			same, replace or add field mCanDumpMontiredSql
NetworkManagementSockeTagger	not found, get it from CM9

OK, these are my ideas, don't blame me if it doesn't work. Try one fix at the time.
TIP: 	adb pull/remove those files for faster logcatting or make an update.zip, 
	so you should only replace the jars and mod the script a bit.
